pcb errors encountered to be corrected after delivery:
-5V arduino to pcb NOT connected
-resistor footprints too big for small SMD components
-add resistor to the 5V used for the NC of the switches, to save for short circuits when switching and NO and NC briefly connected (make before break)
-digits were swapped (changed in software)
-tilt switches: provide dedicated space on board for sensor installation
-usb micro.
-add diodes to protect power supplies. 
-label better: power connector / programming connector.
